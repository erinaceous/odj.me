<p>Today I'm writing about <em>Time</em> - or, my perception of it as someone
with ADHD.</p>

<p>I have a love-hate relationship with time - I simultaneously don't have
nearly enough of it, whilst also having waaaay too much of it.</p>

<!--/summary-->

<h3 class="magenta">Not enough time</h3>

<p>I get by as an adult by <em>only being several minutes late to things</em>.
I'm lucky, I've always been one of those people who worries relentlessly about
being super late, so when I have appointments, obligations and deadlines that
<em>I really have to keep to or I will <strong>literally die*</strong></em>,
I put a lot of energy into planning my day/week accordingly. It's yet
another thing that fatigues my brain.</p>

<p>*Obviously, dramatic embellishment - but that's how it feels - a tendency
to catastrophise one's own lateness, even if it's minor.</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>And I totally get the idea of <strong>waiting mode</strong>: where you're
concerned enough about being on time for one thing, you <em>daren't</em>
do anything interesting on either side of it, in case you get carried away
and it makes you late!</p>

<h4 class="violet">In the mornings</h4>

<p>As a kid and a teenager, I was always leaving my friend hanging around
in my house in the morning when he came by to walk to school together. I
created lots of silly fights and arguments around me due to Creating Lateness
when my family had plans. Part of that is that I've always been a late riser -
very possibly I have a
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6487490/" target="_blank">Delayed Circadian Rhythm Phase</a>,
which subsequently means I naturally start to feel sleepy <em>at like 2AM</em>
and am not really ready to be awake <em>until 10AM</em>. So, as a teenager,
time was <em>not</em> on my side. I was perennially holding people up, whilst
being unprepared and half-asleep still, causing lots of stress, and
<em>I only had myself to blame</em>, because I was the only person keeping
myself awake at night!</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/lq0xzm/accurate/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">

    </a>
</p>

<p>I'm still in that 2AM-10AM cycle. University was fine, although I rarely
made it to 9AM lectures and 10AM ones were a gamble. First &quot;real&quot;
job, I was constantly told off for my consistent lateness - but I made up
for it by staying later in the evenings (which I didn't <em>want</em> to do,
but felt an obligation to). I'm really lucky now that I have a great team
where I work and we have a great culture that's basically &quot;work when it
suits you, just be available for a few core hours&quot;. Given the tolerance
of my shifted sleep schedule, I've remained in that 2AM-10AM pattern since.
I worry that, if I was forced back in to a 9-to-5 routine, I'd rapidly
disintegrate from lack of adequate sleep.</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>I still wish I <em>could</em> be awake and actively doing things earlier -
I take
<a href="https://www.everydayhealth.com/melatonin/guide/" target="_blank">melatonin supplements</a>
to try and induce sleepiness earlier than my brain naturally does, coupled with
<a href="https://www.drugs.com/tips/phenergan-patient-tips" target="_blank">promethazine</a>
to put myself to sleep in the first place. But regardless of whether I take
them, for the first hour after my alarm goes off at the not-so-early time of
9AM, I feel so physically exhausted and groggy that I end up falling asleep
some more until 10AM, even though every day I <em>really really</em> want to
wake earlier to allow myself more time to get ready for the day ahead.</p>

<p>My phone alarms tell this story in the most visual way:</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>As winter draws in, I really want to shift it so that I've been for a run
or done a workout before our daily meetings at 10:30AM - not just make
coffee and blearily start checking my emails twenty minutes before that. But
even <em>with taking stimulant medication</em> on that first alarm - I can
<em>feel</em> the stimulants starting to kick in within that first hour -
it's like I can't physically move right until the last minute when I'll
<em>just have enough time</em> to (hopefully) look a little presentable.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/lcgsn1/getting_out_of_bed_big_roadblock/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
        <img src="https://preview.redd.it/e9nr6sy31hf61.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=971139a4871224ba149defeaa514e3e8fc8be08a" style="max-width:100%" />
    </a>
</p>

<p>Annoyingly, it really is just my brain playing games, because when I
<em>have</em> to get up early - like if in a hotel for a conference and
everything starts at 9AM - I can do that just fine... Well. At least, I
set a dozen alarms starting at 7AM, still have to skip breakfast and
appear where I need to be just on time and feeling exhausted and unprepared
for most of the day.</p>

<p>Sleep schedule and getting enough sleep is a thing I'll probably be working
on for a while. I have blue light filters on all my electronics, blue light
filtering glasses, a cold bedroom, a dark bedroom, a really comfy bed,
a weighted blanket, lavender air fresheners, promethazine, melatonin and
chamomile tea, I don't drink caffeine past midday or drink none at all,
I run, I don't usually drink alcohol in the week, I meditate in the evenings...
But here I am at close to 2AM, and <em>it is the time of day in which I feel
most  able to concentrate and do deep work</em>. Both of my dissertations were
written predominantly between the hours of 11PM til 6AM. It's annoying,
because now is Calm and Productive Time, but I <em>like</em> sunlight and
other humans, <em>am no a vampire!</em></p>

<h4 class="blue">To plan things</h4>

<p>Internally, I feel either <em>incredibly prepared</em> for things, or
<em>woefully under-prepared</em>. I'm better with hard deadlines - like,
a specific date to finish/do something by, a specific time to catch a train
or a plane. Those things are concrete and easy to get a grasp on. Longer-term
goals are always infinitely far out in the future - <em>&quot;I will
definitely think about that later&quot;</em> - until, suddenly, the thing
that was <em>months</em> ago is <em>now</em> and all the preparation I
<em>planned to do</em> in my head <em>for the majority of that time</em> has
not been done whatsoever.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/mtfx5y/was_suppose_to_post_this_long_back/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
        <img src="https://i.redd.it/7ck90wq7jyt61.jpg" style="max-width:100%" />
    </a>
</p>

<p>As a concrete example: I wanted to run a marathon this year! My friend
picked a date and wrote out a training schedule. I was going to stick by
theirs. Then, because we both have motivation issues and different forms of
time-blindness (and life got in the way) (and we got injured), the date by
which that marathon was going to get ran has already passed us by. It's a
long-term goal I <em>really</em> want to do, but is a thing that I will
<em>get around to doing later</em>.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/qb55ei/100/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
        <img src="https://i.redd.it/9v7o11cdjcu71.png" style="max-width:100%" />
    </a>
</p>

<p>Aside from the motivation/procrastination side of things - I think what
I miss with long-term goals is that sense of urgency I get when there is a
clock counting down to a date that <em>I cannot postpone</em> and I have
<em>no choice</em> but to <em>get my shit together</em> and <em>do things</em>.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the <em>get urgent things done right up until the last
minute</em> thing means I end up skipping out on other things I want to do -
<em>&quot;I would've had way more time to enjoy relaxing if only I'd done this
earlier!&quot;</em></p>

<h4 class="cyan">EVER</h4>

<p>The sensation of urgency and time slipping away may be yet another facet
of ADHD -
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6556068/" target="_blank">a 2019 review of research into people with ADHD's perception of time</a>
references a number of studies giving evidence that ADHD brains process and
perceive time differently from the microscopic level (testing reaction times
in milliseconds) all the way up to mapping out our lives. Picking some
quotes from that review that mention processing speed:</p>

<p style="border-left:1ch solid #859900;padding-left:2ch;"><em>&quot;Another
aspect of time that seems to be impaired in ADHD is processing speed. [...]
In a hallmark study from 2006, children and adolescents with ADHD demonstrated
significantly slower processing speeds across an extended battery of rapid
tasks that required either verbal or motor output. [...] When compared with
controls, young people diagnosed with ADHD presenting with predominant
symptoms of inattention showed deficits across several processing speed
measures, including motor speed output, set shifting speed, and verbal
output speed.&quot;</em></p>

<p>That constant sense of urgency probably comes from us being hurried on
a lot throughout our formative years - when you're one of the
<em>&quot;you're bright, but&quot;</em> kids, it's believed that you should
be doing things quicker because you're capable, and you're just not making
an effort. So... instead of taking the time you <em>need</em>, you learn how
to <em>rush</em>, just enough that you can... fail upwards, I guess?</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>Something which multiple friends have noticed is that, as an adult, I do
<em>lots of things quickly</em> - I walk fast, I eat fast, generally I rush
through things at an unnecessary pace. I feel I <em>have</em> to, else I'm
too slow, I'll fall behind. It results either/or carelessness and frazzle.
For me now, more the frazzle. When younger, more the carelessness - rushing
through schoolwork in the last seconds of the lesson. You muddle by without
making accommodations for the slower pace you need.</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>For me, the feeling of <em>not having enough time</em> and also
<em>not granting myself enough time</em> is a common enough thread that
my therapist has started to highlight it. I'm always a few minutes late to
my sessions - when we were only on zoom, I was late. Now I have a commute
to get there, same amount of late. I always appear and feel unprepared, like
I was rushing to get there on time, without any of the prior self-reflection
that would probably benefit talk therapy. It's like I spend my life walking
through doors from one dimension into another, with
<em>not enough spaces in between</em> for my brain to switch contexts. The
main thing we're discovering is that I <em>constantly</em> have this strong
craving just to have <em>more time</em>. I want 25 hours in the day, 8
days a week. Perhaps part of that comes down to <em>masking</em>, and the ways
in which I'm using mental energy to navigate the world - I need more
<em>recovery time</em> than I grant myself?</p>

</p>

<h3 class="yellow">Too much time</h3>

<p>Yet, despite <em>feeling</em> like I'm headless chicken-ing, I have
frustratingly long periods of downtime. I get annoyed with myself. I can't
<em>enjoy</em> my free time, because <em>there's always something looming</em>,
but in order to actually take action, I <em>need</em> that looming deadline.
No matter what mind tricks I try, <em>I will expand into the given space</em>.
I constantly daydream about the magical weekend I'll have one day where I get
what I want to get done on Saturday daytime, leaving no outstanding tasks for
me to feel guilty about not doing, and can then <em>actively enjoy</em>
reading, playing games, or fucking around doing not much of anything - the
wonderful weekend which will leave me feeling <em>rejuvenated</em>. It is a
<em>myth</em>. Annoyingly, if I had the external routine of work forced on me
on the weekends too, I'd probably get what I wanted to get done.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/q2j3v1/understandable_have_a_nice_day/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">

    </a>
</p>

<p>If I had a completely self-directed life with no external deadlines, I'd
probably not do much of anything. I think the sense of urgency gives me enough
of a dopaminergic boost to kick me into action. Honestly, when I'm
<em>doing too many things too soon</em> and having lots of
&quot;near misses&quot; is when I'm <em>thriving</em>. It's not that I am for
lack of ideas, ambition or drive - I just... <em>Don't do stuff on my own
deadlines</em>. The reason I'm still writing this blog every evening is
because I set myself that rule of once a day, and gave myself <em>external
accountability</em> by sharing it with people.</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>I thought I had a counterpoint to this thinking back on lockdown, but I
was one of the fortunate souls who wasn't furloughed and continued working as
normal through them all, and we kept our structure - daily meetings at
10:30AM, a list of things to do, lots of other little meetings, lots of work
things to get done. The only difference was that I didn't leave my flat, so
I gained some extra time to... I'd like to say
&quot;do more of what I enjoyed&quot; but in reality, I expanded out into that
extra time too - extra time not getting up in the morning, but on the
flip-side working when I would've been driving home.</p>

<h3 class="orange">The Ways in Which Time is Different for Me</h3>

<p>The fore-mentioned
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6556068/#b16-medscimonit-25-3918" target="_blank">review</a>
into how people with ADHD perceive time was/is a fascinating read for me, and
I wish I'd had time to read it properly before sitting down to write this, but
- irony, despite only doing work and cooking dinner today, I didn't give myself
enough time to really plan this post. I just opened up an editor and started
typing away. I skim-read the study quickly. I'm going to try and summarize
the findings now, though.</p>

<ul class="long">
    <li><strong class="red">My day is shifted to the right:</strong> Delayed
    Circadian Rhythm Phase.</li>
    <li><strong class="magenta">I process conversations slower:</strong> Like
    I mentioned in <a href="/blog/2021-10-23-senses">a previous post</a>,
    I have delays in auditory processing.</li>
    <li><strong class="violet">I react slower:</strong> I was a clumsy kid, and
    I'm not great at sports that involve things like catching today. There are
    plenty of occasions now where I can <em>feel</em> that I'm taking longer
    to react than I notice other people do.</li>
    <li><strong class="blue">My time estimations are impaired:</strong> The
    review references several studies in which children were asked to
    estimate some passage of time, and the ADHD groups greatly overestimated
    or underestimated both how much time they <em>predicted</em> something
    <em>would</em> take, as well as how much time a task <em>had</em> taken.
    I get that - without a clock visibly available, everything is just
    <em>now</em> or <em>future</em>.</li>
    <li><strong class="cyan">I live in the present:</strong> Whilst I
    <em>do</em> reminisce about the past and daydream about the future
    constantly, I find it reeeally hard to concretely conceptualize the
    future in order to set myself long-term goals. It's just this curious
    thing always over the horizon. In order to make sense of future time,
    I have to be able to visibly see it, like in calendar form, so that
    it is a <em>tangible thing</em>.</li>
    <li><strong class="green">I get impatient quicker:</strong> The review
    posits that my &quot;inner clock seems to run faster than in normal
    individuals&quot; and that boring and repetitive tasks are perceived as
    dragging on much longer than for individuals without ADHD.</li>
    <li><strong class="yellow">I benefit from medication:</strong> This is
    something I noticed fairly early on with medication: <em>I was checking
    the time more often</em>, whilst also noticing that
    <em>I had more time</em> (though not perceiving it going slower), and
    most importantly for me, <em>I get better at keeping my own deadlines</em>
    - if I say I'm going to switch tasks at 2PM (like, if I have a video call),
    on meds, I notice where I'm at at like, 1:50PM, giving me time to casually
    finish up the previous thing, and give myself a little gap before starting
    the next thing <em>on time</em>. Off meds, things have a tendency of
    blurring together.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3 class="orange">The Ways in Which It is the Same</h3>

<p><strong>Music.</strong> Tempo. I can definitely keep a beat just fine.
I think playing in a large wind band as a kid helped with my immediate
time-keeping. My empirical corpus of evidence for this is: I just did
<a href="https://www.concerthotels.com/got-rhythm" target="_blank">this little test</a>
a few times and consistently scored over 800 (my highest was 813, think you
can beat me, reader?). I am able to keep a consistent running pace without
requiring a constant external beat. So whilst there's these studies showing
how reactions are slowed and time is perceived differently for ADHD brains,
maybe <em>rhythm</em> is unaffected, and it's <em>rhythm</em> that allows
us to get by in our lives - as much as we <em>despise</em> doing it, giving
ourselves a good routine allows us to better predict and plan ahead, when
all of our routine stuff has a known duration.</p>

<h3 class="red">Time Blindness</h3>

<p>I do quite a lot of this:</p>

<ol class="long">
    <li>Have a Thing to do at 12:00</li>
    <li>Be doing another Thing before then</li>
    <li>Consistently acknowledge the passage of time from 11:00, 11:01, 11:02
        ...11:56, 57, 58, 59... 12:00...... 12:01..........</li>
    <li>Acknowledge that it's time to do the Thing</li>
    <li>??????</li>
    <li>12:05, start doing the Thing</li>
</ol>

    </a>
</p>

<p>I feel like I'm one of the lucky ones; I'm suitably self-conscious enough
that I'm just consistently slightly late for most things. I have friends for whom
time-blindness has been a much greater source of stress for them - crying
in a ball stress the night before a university assignment. &quot;I'll be there
at 8&quot; invariably means they'll be there at 11. Lots of last-minute
panic-packing for trips. But my own time-blindness makes me very
<a href="https://adhdhomestead.net/time-blindness-feels/" target="_blank">empathetic</a>
towards them - <em>I get it</em>.</p>

</p>

<p>It's hard to describe, because you can literally <em>see the time in front
of you</em> but... You just have stuff <em>you need to get done</em>, and
it's always taking longer than you anticipated. &quot;Packing my stuff for
a camping trip? I'll get it all done in an hour mate&quot; - cue us pitching
our tents in the dark, because somehow it took five hours.</p>

<p>So part of
<a href="https://www.commlearn.com/time-adhd/" target="_blank">time blindness</a>
is where executive dysfunction
(the &quot;not being able to switch task easily&quot; part of it)
conspires to either distract you or put you into a hyper-focus flow state - so
you're either late for things because you were doing nothing when you should
have been doing something, or you're late because you were <em>so</em> engrossed in
doing something, you stop checking the time - until... <em>Shit, two hours
have passed!?</em>
</p>

<h3 class="magenta">The Things I Use to Help</h3>

<p>After writing this, I went back and added some links to articles about
time blindness and discovered that they had pretty much the same list, 
paraphrased or with a few more additions here and there. This is just stuff
I've found that <em>I</em> do personally...</p>

<ul class="long">
    <li><strong class="violet">Manage expectations -</strong> I'm probably gonna be a little
    late. Don't take it personally. I'm doing the best I can.</li>
    <li><strong class="blue">Wristwatch, naturally</strong> (when I remember to put the bloody
        thing on!) - so the time is always readily available in my eyeline.</li>
    <li><strong class="cyan">Music,</strong> which has a steady tempo and known durations of
    time. Transition between songs is a nice audible cue for the passage of
    time.</li>
    <li><strong class="green">Calendars,</strong> and for work, Gantt Charts - so I can see
    the passage of time visually. With those, I realise that
    &quot;2nd November 2021&quot; is in fact <em>not</em> infinitely far into
    the future, but is <em>Tuesday</em>.
    My rule of thumb is, <em>it ain't happening if it ain't on the calendar.</em>
    All my work reminders, volunteering stuff and personal stuff all goes on
    the same calendar in different colours. I add things to it
    <em>the moment</em> that I find out about it - no, &quot;I'll add that to
    the calendar later&quot;, because I won't.
    </li>
    <li><strong class="yellow">Route planner apps.</strong>
    The really accurate duration estimations for a journey on apps remove
    a real cognitive load from me. On the occasions I don't look up how to get
    somewhere, I am <em>so</em> wrong about how long it'll take. I'm usually
    <em>on time or early</em> when I'm relying on public transport, because
    the time-keeping is externalised. I just go where it tells me to go at
    the time it tells me to leave.</li>
    <li><strong class="orange">Overestimation -</strong> now, I assume that however long
    something's going to take, I should round it up to the nearest, say,
    half-hour.</li>
    <li><strong class="red">On days where time-keeping is absolutely crucial</strong>
    (like, getting a
    train to an airport to catch a flight), on the day(s) beforehand I will
    write myself a <em>ridiculously</em> finely-grained itinerary, which can
    be down to <em>the minute</em> - like, <em>I have 3 minutes to brush my
    teeth, 3 minutes to put my shoes on</em> level of detail, from the moment
    I'm supposed to wake up. Then, based on those estimations, I do the
    over-estimating thing so I have a little wiggle-room. <strong>The extra
    wiggle-room means that I am actually on time, rather than late</strong> -
    like, leaving the house <em>just</em> when I needed to be. I feel like
    a really hopeless adult writing scripts for myself like
    <strong>7:03 BRUSH TEETH</strong>, but it <em>works</em>. This gets
    referred to by people as <em>task chunking</em>.</li>
    <li><strong class="magenta">And now, medication!</strong>
    Which seems to aid in giving me
    more of an intuitive grasp of the passage of time - but doesn't necessarily
    allow me to switch tasks any easier, so the extra focus it gives me can
    be a bit of a double-edged sword when it comes to being on time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stuff I <em>don't</em> use is stuff like Pomodoro timers (or, kitchen
timers), to tell me whenever 20 minutes has passed. That doesn't gel well
with what I do for work, generally - you do <em>not</em> want to be ripped
out of your deep thinking state by a timer going off periodically. In my case
I'll probably just start ignoring it when its novelty runs out after the first
few times it rings!</p>

<p>Looking back at this post after writing it, I feel like I've been venting
a bit and not <em>solutions-oriented</em>, but honestly I think I've got
a pretty good handle on my time-management, and have had for quite a while -
aside from being <em>slightly</em> late, I very very rarely do things like
miss transport or turn up stupid late for important things. I've found good
ways of externalizing my timekeeping and working memory. Where I'd like to
improve is longer-term thinking, and having more of a Normal Person sleep
cycle. On that note...</p>
