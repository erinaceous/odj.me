<title>Owain's Blog - 12+1 Days of ADHD</title>
<p align="right"><strong class="red">12 (+1) Days of ADHD</strong><br />
Saturday 16th October, 2021</p>

<p>October is ADHD Awareness Month. I've decided that I'm going to use
that as a writing prompt, and to set myself a challenge. For the next
twelve days, I'm going to write <i>something</i> about my experiences
learning about ADHD as a very recently diagnosed adult.</p>

<p>So why 12 days? Like the Twelve Days of Christmas, except instead
of partridges and pear trees I'll be waxing lyrical about executive
dysfunction, the Bastard that is working memory, non-linear thinking,
and the myriad of other neurodivergent things which have shaped the
very core of my personality throughout my life without me ever
realizing it.</p>

<p>The connection to Christmas is incidental. Thought process:</p>

<ul>
	<li>"I should write something about ADHD this month"</li>
	<li>"I should write some<b>things</b> about ADHD this month"</li>
	<li>"I should write some things across several days this month"</li>
	<li>"I should write for like, seven days this month"</li>
	<li>"Haha, how does that song about Christmas go? AND A PARTRIDGE IN A PEAR TREE"</li>
	<li>"I should write for twelve days this month, like the song"</li>
</ul>

<p>I have no advance plan as to what I'm going to write about, or when
I'm going to, or how much I should try to write. I just know that for
the next 12 days I <i>have</i> to write <i>something</i>.</p>

<p>That seems like a reasonable way of getting into writing, especially
self-reflective writing, especially especially self-reflective writing
which I intend to broadcast to a wider audience! It's longer than a week,
so has a chance to blossom into a longer habit, but 12 days still feels
short enough that I can push myself to the finish line, should I lose
interest halfway through (which is... likely).</p>

<p>I hope that I can share some useful insights along the way, but
ultimately this excercise in picking up writing as a new habit is my
own personal challenge.</p>

<p>Hasta manyana!</p>
