</strong><br />
Monday 18th October, 2021</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2021-10-16-twelve-plus-one-days-of-adhd">October is ADHD
Awareness Month.</a> I've decided that I'm going to use that as a writing
prompt, and to set myself a challenge. For the next twelve days, I'm going
to <a href="/blog/2021-10-17-action-potential">write something</a> about
my experiences learning about ADHD as a very recently diagnosed adult.</em></p>

<p>Third day of writing, and I felt like reflecting on my personality - picking
out the stuff that I think is related to ADHD.</p>

<p>This is far from an exhaustive list. I just told myself to write for like,
twenty minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong><br />
Smart kid.<br />
Kid who "just needed to apply himself more".<br />
Kid who took things apart that he should't be taking apart.<br />
Kid who got into trouble for arguing with authority figures.<br />
Kid who got into trouble for his jokes in class.<br />
Kid who got inconceivably frustrated when things he did weren't immediately
perfect.<br />
Kid who always felt a little bit alien, even before he internalised the
innocent labels - "dreamy", "space cadet", "eccentric".<br />
Kid who felt like he's missing scripts for social stuff that everyone else seems
to have.<br />
Kid who can't get up before 10am.<br />
Kid who can't fall asleep before 3am.</br >
Kid who never gets enough sleep.<br />
Kid who needed to present his work better.<br />
Kid who outdid predictions anyway.<br />
Kid who never did his homework, but could hyper-focus on - in retrospect -
really really boring programming stuff.<br />
Kid who grew an affinity to computers from an early age.<br />
Kid who really, really struggled with mathematics.<br />
Kid who was told he'd need maths for what he wanted to do.<br />
Kid who only ever had/has the vaguest idea <em>what</em> he wants to do.<br />
Kid who got two first-class degrees in computer science regardless.<br />
Kid with explosive emotions.<br />
Kid who learnt later than others how and when to have a filter.<br />
Kid who is clumsy, forgetful, vague, shy.<br />
Kid who was quite happy acting and playing solos in national music competitions
anyway.<br />
Kid who mixes tenses.<br />
Kid who wears fluorescent bright clothes at festivals and raves.<br />
Kid who absolutely did <em>not give two shits</em> how he was perceived when
excited enough by something.<br />
Kid who was incredibly sensitive, anxious, self-conscious and who "needs to<br />
stop being so hard on himself".<br />
Kid who walked home without his shoes when he lost them between lessons.<br />
Kid who had more doodles than notes in his textbooks.<br />
Kid who inadvertently covered his hands in ink.<br />
Kid who chews his inner lip, bites his nails, clacks his teeth, tenses muscles,
twitches legs, impercetibly as to not be told off for fidgeting.<br />
Kid who destroys pen caps by just being near them.<br />
Kid with a high IQ, but a low 25th percentile score in the
<a href="https://www.pearsonclinical.co.uk/Psychology/AdultCognitionNeuropsychologyandLanguage/AdultGeneralAbilities/rbans/RepeatableBatteryfortheAssessmentofNeuropsychologicalStatus(RBANS).aspx">RBANS</a>
tests for Delayed Memory.<br />
Kid who has his own place, has been working a stable job for 6 years, keeps relatively tidy - but still feels like daily life is the Trial of Sisyphus.<br />
Kid who has three times: "now", "in a minute", and "infinitely far into the future".<br />
Kid who, when asked, can't remember what he did today or yesterday.<br />
Kid who, when not prompted, can recite an entire Simpsons episode from the Conan O' Brien era 90's episodes.<br />
Kid who eats fast.<br />
Kid who walks fast.<br />
Kid who is paradoxically both incredibly observant and unobservant at the same time.<br />
Kid who really, really needs external structure, comfort and support.<br />
Kid who doesn't want to be fucking told what to do, stop pressuring him, he'll do it his own way damnit, and stop being patronising.<br />
Kid who is acutely aware of his paradoxes.<br />
Kid who gets by, by writing lists.
