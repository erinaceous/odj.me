<p><em><a href="/blog/2021-10-16-twelve-plus-one-days-of-adhd">October is ADHD
Awareness Month.</a> I've decided that I'm going to use that as a writing
prompt, and to set myself a challenge. For the next twelve days,
<a href="/blog/2021-10-17-action-potential">I'm going</a>a
to <a href="/blog/2021-10-18-whoami">write something</a>

<a href="/blog/2021-10-23-senses">adult.</a></em></p>

<p>After writing at length into the wee hours two nights in a row, I'm pretty
mentally tired today and <em>actually sleepy</em> for once, so I'm going to
seize this opportunity to fall asleep at <em>regular people hours</em>. I
have things I want to write about, but nothing I can get done quickly. So
today, I come with no content, and this post is essentially cheating, but
the idea is to stick with a habit as opposed to worrying too much about the
quality of output of said habit.</p>

<p>However - I did get some feedback about the readability of this blog and
have since implemented a
<a href="" onclick="toggle_bright_mode(); return false">light mode</a>.
Was interesting to hear from another person who experiences Palinopsia
(the ghosting/after-effect thing related to visual snow) that they are the
opposite to me, in that bright text on dark backgrounds are quite difficult
for them to focus on.</p>

<p>I also have been reading voraciously about visual snow still, and thinking of
extra adaptations I could make to make it easier and more enjoyable for me to
read again. I realised today that <em>the easiest thing for me to read on</em> is
in fact my smartphone! The narrow width screen, and <em>ability to scroll</em>
so that the line I'm reading is always at the top, helps a lot with reading,
as I'm not getting "lost" between the lines due to so much aura, glow and
after-image in the gaps between lines and words. It's a shame that it is a
light emitting source - even with an orange filter, reading on my phone will
keep me awake. Which is unfortunate because it is <em>so much easier</em> for
me to read with than paperback.</p>

<p>I have a kindle, and that's <em>okay</em>, but it just feels like another
book to me. Wouldst that it had "highlight the line I'm on" or continuous
scrolling (as opposed to page turning) on the older Kindle Paperwhites!</p>

<p>I went down a rabbit-hole researching e-readers and their accessibility
features whilst writing this, so may have some more fleshed out thoughts at
a later date. I'm starting to wonder whether using some of the tricks,
techniques and tools that dyslexic people use may help Make Reading Comfortable
Again for people with noisy vision.</p>
