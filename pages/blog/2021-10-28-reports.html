<a href="/blog/2021-10-17-yagni">adult</a>.</em></p>

<p>Today is the final day of my challenge! I started off wanting to write
some interesting stuff about working memory, because I'm fascinated by the
neuroscience of this all - but I got stuck in a bit of a rabbit-hole trying
to try and find studies which had tested people with ADHD diagnoses using
the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeatable_Battery_for_the_Assessment_of_Neuropsychological_Status" target="_blank">RBANS</a>
test in particular - as that's the one I happened to do, and admittedly in
not-exactly clinical settings (sat in a bedroom, probably a bit hungover?).
It's one of
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/8ss131/diagnostic_impression_attentiondeficit/" target="_blank">many other</a>
psychological test batteries that could be used to support a diagnosis.
Unfortunately I haven't found any papers or studies that specifically
reference the use of RBANS in comparing ADHD groups (especially ADHD adults)
against healthy controls, so I can't really tell what my own scores mean.</p>

<p>In the midst of all that, though - when I dug up my scan of the RBANS
test, I also dug up a document I wrote back in February, where I've
conveniently taken all of the choice quotes from my school reports and onwards.
I wanted to share them here, because they <em>really</em> tell a story of
me growing up!</p>

<p><em>If you've ever wondered about yourself and you still have school
reports - dig 'em <strong>up!!!</strong></em> You may find that yours have a
similar story which only stands out when you have a better idea of what you're
looking for - maybe my reports can give some insight...</p>

<!--/summary-->

<h2 class="magenta">RBANS results</h2>

<p>First though, I thought I'd share my results from that RBANS test:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wt5ozac.png" title="Scan of the results" style="max-width:100%">
</p>

<ul class="long">
    <li>
        <strong>Immediate Memory:</strong> score of 78 - <strong>7th percentile.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Visuospatial/Constructional:</strong> score of 121 - </strong>92nd</strong> percentile.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Language:</strong> score of 92 - <strong>30th</strong> percentile.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Attention:</strong> score of 97 - <strong>92nd</strong> percentile.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Delayed Memory</strong> score of 94 - <strong>34th</strong> percentile.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The index scores don't scale linearly against each other, hence why a score
of 97 in one category might be 92nd percentile, whilst a score of 94 in another
is only 94th. The percentile means, <em>&quot;out of all the people around the
same age, gender, background, health, I score higher than this percentage
of them in this category (for UK/USA).&quot;</em> So, I'm pretty great at
<strong>visuospatial/constructional</strong> things, and ironically my
<strong>attention</strong> scores are really good. My <strong>language</strong>
and <strong>delayed memory</strong> functioning scores put me in the lower
third of guys my age. And my <strong>immediate memory</strong>
was... <em>seventh percentile</em>.</p>

<p>I will ask my friend about interpreting the results again and refrain from
commenting too much - I think some of the categories are not what you would
expect, and/or where Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is badly-named.
<em>Attention</em> was tested using digit span (repeat a growing
sequence of numbers after the assessor says them) and coding (match abstract
symbols with numbers within a time limit). No problem <em>holding</em>
sustained attention in those circumstances, given a task which I am
intellectually invested in which my brain finds rewarding and which I have
chosen to do of my own volition.</p>

<p>I also found it surprising that I scored as low as I did on
<em>language</em>. The first test for that was naming things in pictures,
and the second was semantic fluency - &quot;name all the fruits and vegetables
you can think of in sixty seconds&quot;. Which to me doesn't feel like
testing <em>language</em> per se, but <em>category recall</em> or something.
It wasn't, like, finding anagrams or thinking of synonyms or testing ability
to communicate abstract information. So, again, the categories may not be
what we think they are - or not what I'd assume them to be at first glance
anyway.</p>

<p>Still though - with the caveats of <em>OK what do I make of this</em> -
the <strong>seventh percentile immediate memory</strong> thing is really
something that got my attention. The tests for that were list learning
(repeat a long list of words after assessor has read them out loud) and
story memory (listen to a short story and try to repeat as much as you
remember, using as much as the same wording as possible). That's stuff
I've always struggled with - <em>following instructions! Following recipes!
Remembering directions!</em></p>

<p>So: phone numbers and IP addresses and passwords and registration plates
and postcodes: I am <em>top dog</em> remembering. Bunch of different people's
names in a social gathering? <em>Nul points.</em></p>

<h2 class="violet">School reports</h2>

<p>These are all the choice quotes I took from my school reports, dating back
to when I was in reception. They are from a mix of my regular reports, and
the <em>individual education plan</em> I was on, which was part of the school's
special educational needs (SEN) provision. Typing these out again, having
had over half a years worth of research and reading and incorporating
information, is quite cathartic - should I ever get that
<em>impostor syndrome</em> about being neuro-divergent because on the surface
<em>I'm functional adult</em>, I can look back at <em>the work I put in
getting there</em>.</p>

<h3 class="blue">5&half; years old</h3>

<p><strong>School Report:</strong> Owain enjoys stories but <u>finds it more
difficult to listen in class</u> discussion times <u>and to instructions</u>.
He <u>will answer questions if asked directly</u> but will not volunteer
information. Owain also enjoys singing and percussion. <em>He often sings
during other lesson times too.</em> Owain <u>often seems to be in a world of
his own</u>. <u>Under constant supervision</u> he can work quite well but
needs to work more independently and conscientiously. Owain does associate
more with the other children now and is beginning to learn to cooperate more
with everyone.</p>

<h3 class="cyan">6 years old</h3>

<p><strong>School Report:</strong> Owain tends to be <u>a little dreamy</u>
and he <u>finds it difficult to listen to others</u>. He also has
<u>difficulty waiting for his turn to speak</u>. Owain is enthusiastic
during P.E., but he <u>needs to listen more carefully to instructions</u>.
Owain is a capable boy who could do much better if he could <u>concentrate
on his work</u>. He is <u>now able to sit quietly</u>, but he still
<u>has difficulty working with a group of children</u>. He has
<u>worked very hard at not wandering around the class</u> when he should be
sitting and hopefully this will continue. Owain wants to do well and is
helpful around the class when he is asked.</p>

<h3 class="green">6&half; years old</h3>

<p><strong>School Report:</strong> Owain needs to <u>concentrate on the
consistency of his good work.</u> Owain finds mathematics more challenging
than language and <u>often becomes annoyed and distracted if faced with a
problem that is not straightforward</u>. Owain has a good understanding of
scientific concepts but <u>can be impatient and cross</u> if his predictions
or investigations do not turn out as he expects. His work is <u>lively and
imaginative</u> but he finds some cutting/shaping work difficult and
<u>gets frustrated</u>. Owain still has <u>a lot of co-ordination problems
and finds this frustrating at times.</u> He can <u>get distracted</u> at
times. Owain always <u>contributes to discussions</u> but <u>does not listen
to others' points of view.</u> Owain works well when he applies himself.
His <u>attitude and behaviour will need careful monitoring</u>.</p>

<h3 class="yellow">7 years, 4 months old</h3>

<p class="sidenote">(This is where it becomes more outwardly obvious that
I'm a bit of an Odd One, it seems ðŸ‘½. I have no idea what &quot;laterality has
not been established&quot; means!)</p>

<p><strong>Individual Education Plan:</strong> Owain appears to be a very able
boy who likes talking, has an excellent vocabulary with a mature expression,
is reading well and writes with fluency and expression. Progress in maths is
less advanced and although generally well-coordinated, <u>laterality has not
been established</u>. His behaviour in class and playground have been giving
<u>increasing cause for concern.</u> He has <u>difficulties cooperating and
interacting with peers</u>, has developed <u>various unusual mannerisms</u>
and <u>his learning and that of his peers are being affected.</u> He finds it
<u>difficult functioning within the class</u>, eg. <u>listening to and
following instructions</u>, in <u>waiting his turn to speak</u> and
<u>listening to other people's point of view</u>.
He becomes <u>very frustrated and angry</u> when constructions do not achieve
his desired aim. Targets. <u>sit in his place without being reminded,</u>
work <u>without making noises</u>.</p>

<h3 class="orange">7 years, 9 months old</h3>

<p class="sidenote">(So this is where I start getting Disruptive and being
The Annoying One in class. Interesting that it's noted that I find it
difficult to make eye contact, but there's no mention if anyone asked why..!
(I still don't really know why. Eyes are overstimulating I guess?). Mum says
as difficult as it was back then to get GP referrals for this sort of stuff,
there's even more barriers for parents these days, requiring them to sit in
&quot;what if you're just Parenting Wrong&trade;&quot; classes before they'll
be referred...)</p>

<p><strong>Individual Education Plan:</strong> Owain is now in a mixed Y3/Y4
class of higher achievers. His behaviour is not such a problem because there
is <u>room for him to be on his own</u> on the few occasions when he
<u>has made noises</u> and his peers are less distractable. However he finds
situations like assembly, waiting for the bus for Kids' Club after school
and lining up to come in after play the most difficult to cope with and
<u>does not seem aware of the effect of his behaviour on others</u>.
<u>Questions sometimes have to be repeated</u>. He
<u>finds it difficult to make eye-contact unless he is really relaxed</u> at
home, and seldom at school and <u>lack of facial expression or appropriate
responses in conversation</u> can <u>make it appear that he is not paying
attention</u>. Socially he has made an effort to join in football games and
has enjoyed it. He has settled into the class readily but <u>does not settle
down to work as quickly as is required</u> and so <u>often does not have time
to complete tasks</u> of which he is capable. Overall <u>presentation of work
needs attention</u> and reversals are a problem, particularly with numbers.
<u>Referral to the Educational Psychologist was discussed</u> but was felt to
be inappropriate at the moment, but it is suggested that his parents
<u>consider asking their GP for a Speech and Language assessment</u>. Parents
report that Owain <u>has difficulty getting to sleep at night</u> and wonder
if this may be influencing his moods and performance. Of concern is his
<u>lack of awareness</u> of the effect of his behaviour on others and his
<u>difficulty in exercising self-control in situations where he is not
directly supervised.</u></p>

<h3 class="red">8 years old</h3>

<p class="sidenote">(So I'm still growing into an Alien ðŸ‘½ at this point. I
have to admit, I did laugh a towards the end of this at the somewhat
exasperated tone of my teachers. Can't help but admit, unknown dysfunctions
aside, I was a bit of an Antagonistic Asshole Child at times, clearly.)</p>

<p><strong>School Report:</strong> Owain must <u>recognise the importance of
listening to others'</u> ideas when working collaboratively. A recent test
shows his reading age to be well above his chronological age. Owain
<u>needs to develop a clear and legible handwriting style.</u> He <u>must
take greater care to present his work</u> well. Owain displays <u>very
individual characteristics</u> at school. The quality of his work <u>depends
upon the amount of concentration</u> he employs. As he matures he will need
to realise that <u>his manner could be interpreted as rude and arrogant</u>.
In a one to one situation, it is possible to have an intelligent conversation
with Owain. His <u>idiosyncrasies sometimes lead to misunderstandings</u>, but
Owain is beginning to accept that others may have a different viewpoint. He is
not always <em>willing to concede that a different viewpoint may be just as
valid as his own!</em></p>

<p><strong>Individual Education Plan:</strong> Owain's behaviour in class and
playground are improving. <u>Targets: Respond at first hearing name.</u>
Owain has made good progress in terms of presentation. His handwriting has
improved and there is no longer a reversal problem with numbers. He is
settling to work more quickly. Maths is now age appropriate. There are still
problems when Owain waits for Kids' Club - <u>loud voice</u> - and in being
ready to line up to come in at playtime. He is making better eye contact and
interacting better with peers. His parents say he is sleeping better but
<u>doesn't remember the names of peers he talks about</u> at home.</p>

<p><em>(After this the reports change format a bit and went from listing my
age to listing my year group)</em></p>

<h3 class="magenta">Year 4 (8-9 years old)</h3>

<p class="sidenote">(Having context of the previous report, one thing really
bugs me here: Get told that I talk too much, too loud, too distracting,
have odd behaviours, misunderstand, argue too much... and
then my teachers are surprised when I don't participate in discussions...! The
&quot;occasional outbursts directed at himself&quot; is the beginning of the
shitty self-esteem and coping mechanisms that ADHD'ers grow into...)</p>

<p><strong>School Report:</strong> Owain's behaviour has been much more
appropriate this year and his <u>occasional outbursts</u> have been
<u>directed at himself</u>! He has revealed a lovely sense of humour and a
willingness to help himself by <u>consciously making an effort to listen to
instructions</u> and ask if he is still not sure. He <u>still needs to
concentrate on what is going on around him</u> and should <u>try to
participate more consistently</u> in class discussions, as he has a lot to
offer the class. His <u>listening skills still leave something to be desired</u>
at times, but he is working hard to improve them and is making progress! He
sometimes produces calculations etc. which are not required or are
irrelevant because his <u>attention has lapsed</u>. He <u>needs to concentrate
on instructions</u> rather than guess what is required! Owain does sometimes
ask when he does not know what to do, but he needs to do this more often to
save himself a lot of unnecessary work. Owain's designs are innovative and
thoughtful. He <u>sometimes has problems with fine motor skills</u> when
constructing and this can <u>lead to a loss of temper (with himself)</u>. He
is <u>not always as attentive as he should be</u>, which leads to his
misunderstanding of instructions etc.</p>

<h3 class="violet">Year 5 (9-10 years old)</h3>

<p class="sidenote">(Again, not gonna hide the fact I could be an argumentative
lil shit ðŸ˜… - and whilst it's a blur to me, I am appreciative of my friends
and classmates who were supporting me in my formative years, sometimes
completely unbeknownst to me. Some of those kids I've known since playgroup
and we still keep in touch. ðŸ’œ Evidently I got bored quickly in class
sometimes - with an intensely novelty-seeking brain, and would LOUDLY argue
because it is also a black-and-white thinking, highly emotional brain. And
a clumsy one too, hence the reluctance in PE...)</p>

<p><strong>School Report:</strong> Owain is capable of producing work of a
very high standard. The majority of the time he does work conscientiously and
puts much thought into his work, but he <u>does have a tendency to
&quot;switch off&quot;</u> at times when he feels he can do what the class are
learning. He <u>then finds that he does not understand the task</u> in hand,
but <u>will not accept that it his fault for not listening</u>. Owain needs
to accept that although he is very intelligent he is not <em>always</em>
correct, and if this is the case he <u>should not answer back or sit and talk
out-loud to himself</u> about how he disagrees. Owain has some very
supportive friends who <u>try to calm him down if he is disagreeing</u> with
something or someone and they encourage him in PE. Owain needs to put the
energy he uses complaining into his work, then he will be very successful in
his school work. Owain needs to use his ICT skills to produce higher quality
work, <u>not to go off on a tangent</u> and think that he can do his own thing
in the lesson. Owain lacks enthusiasm in PE although the other children in the
class encourage him a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Music Teacher:</strong> Owain has had a mixed year. At times he
has been <u>quite disorganized</u> and hasn't perpared his pieces. Yet he has
worked well on his Grade 2 pieces. If he continues to work in this manner I
would be prepared to enter him for the exam at the next session.</p>

<h3 class="blue">Year 6 (10-11 years old)</h3>

<p class="sidenote">(Pretty telling that only by this point am I making
friends, and
that this is something of note. I think anyone who knows me now knows I'm
a pretty quiet, reserved person a lot of the time - certainly do a lot less
thinking aloud! There seems to be a contradiction in this report where I'm
told to slow down (take more care in work) but also speed up (be less
methodical and get better at meeting deadlines). Also kinda funny to me that
this outstandingly muscial, dramatic, vividly imaginative kid turned out to
be a software engineer...! Not dissing the creativity of my profession,
but... bit of a change)</p>

<p><strong>School Report:</strong> Whereas at the beginning of the year Owain
was <u>on the social periphery of the group</u>, as the year has progressed
his self-confidence has increased. It is <u>good to see him forming
friendships</u>. Owain is <u>modest about his abilities and seems
embarrassed</u> that others admire his outstanding musical and dramatic
talents. Owain is a complex character and his <u>habit of &quot; thinking
aloud&quot;</u> can seem like challenging behaviour to those who don't know
him well. He really must <u>try not to verbalise to the extent that he
does.</u> Owain needs to continue to focus on the technical aspects of his
writing where there is still room for improvement to be made with punctuation.
Owain is not a natural mathematician and is <u>easily frustrated</u>. If he
took a more active role in the learning part of the lesson and <u>gave himself
more times to think things through</u> I am sure that he would make fewer
errors. He <u>tends to be a little impatient</u> with the result that his
<u>recorded work can be untidy</u>. Owain can work as part of a group but is
happier working individually. He <u>must be patient and follow
instructions</u>. He has a vivid imagination and makes the most of his ideas.
His <u>planning is very methodical</u> and he <u>often struggles to meet
deadlines</u>. Owain thinks that he is no good at sport and doesn't really
give himself a fair chance.</p>

<p><strong>Music Teacher:</strong> Owain has had a mixed year. In the autumn
term we were able to build on the success of Owain's Grade 2 exam, but the
spring term was very disappointing. Owain managed only 4 effective lessons in
the spring term as he <u>repeatedly forgot his music and diary</u>.
<u>Damage to his instrument</u> also meant two weeks without it. Summer term
has been much better, and we are now working towards Grade 3 in autumn.</p>

<div class="hr"></div>

<p>So - there are definitely words and phrases which spring up constantly
throughout those reports. <em>Needs to pay more attention. Easily frustrated.
Can be a little impatient. Needs to listen and remember instructions better.
Needs to get better at taking turns speaking. Talks too much. Doesn't remain
seated. Has difficulty keeping quiet. Loses things necessary for tasks. Needs
to take more care in work. Doesn't appear to listen when spoken to directly.
</em></p>

<p>Hmmm... Is it just <em>me</em>, or do those reports tick off pretty much
<em>every bullet point</em> relating to both inattention and
hyperactivity-impulsivity in the
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html" target="_blank">DSM-5 Criteria for ADHD</a>????</p>

<p>Whilst these are school reports, so they're focusing on performance and
behaviour predominantly - it also strikes me just how much of the language is
all about how I <em>have to</em> or <em>need to</em> or <em>must</em> improve
at things - at the start it was worded differently; <em>has difficulties
with</em> or <em>struggles with</em>, whereas later on it was much more
focused on <em>ways in which I had to do better</em>.</p>

<p>I'm not sharing these reports to argue anything written was Wrong, and I
don't harbor any resentment to teachers or anyone else growing up. The purpose
of sharing them is to paint a picture of where I <em>did</em> have a whole
bunch of difficulties, but all difficulties that presented as
<em>behavioural</em> and <em>conduct</em> problems, and subsequently managed
to fly under the radar - but as some of the later reports show, I was
effectively coping <em>despite</em> myself sometimes, or at least that is
how I felt. I didn't understand that I was neurodiverse, I just knew I was
having trouble with X but I could do better if I just <em>tried</em>.</p>

<h2 class="cyan">Psychiatrist's Report in 2013 (me at age 20)</h2>

<p class="sidenote">(So I was sort of on the right track here! Just looking at
the overlapping characteristics between ASD and ADHD from the wrong side of
the venn diagram, perhaps... Looking back, when I visited the psychologist
I was talking of
<a href="/blog/2021-10-23-senses">Auditory Processing problems</a>,
periods of burn-out, feeling like a bit of an alien, hyper-focusing on personal
interests, and <a href="/blog/2021-10-26-time">delayed/shifted sleep cycle</a>.)</p>

<p>Owain has been doing some background reading and wonders if hr has
high-functioning autism/Asperger's difficulties. I asked Owain to try and
produce a summary list of his current problems:</p>

<ul class="long">
    <li>He said he has noticed <u>difficulty with eye contact</u> and that this
    was pointed out to him when he was in the sixth form by his peer group.
    They noticed how difficult he found it to hold gaze for any normal period.</li>
    <li>Owain described <u>difficulty in rapdily processing what other people
    are saying</u>. For example, he said he is taking driving lessons and gets
    instructions for left and right confused, or he responds to an instruction
    but then does not undertake that action.</li>
    <li>At other himes he says he finds has <u>has to ask someone to repeat
    things</u> as it <u>may take him a few seconds to realise that someone
    is talking to him</u>.</li>
    <li>He says he <u>works better when there is no-one else in the office.</u></li>
    <li>&quot;Going in and out of depression.&quot; I asked him to break this
    down for me. He says he has noticed since 16 or so that he may have
    <u>periods of a few days at a time</u> when he feels <u>low in energy,
    motivation, focus and concentration</u>, although he finds if he
    <u>gets into a routine</u> then this tends to stave off these feelings.
    He has never experienced tearfulness or suicidality. Since the move to
    Plymouth he feels these depressive days have become slightly more common
    and at those times he will tend to have a <u>day/night rteversal</u> where
    he will stay up. Nevertheless, he seemed quite <u>happy in his night time
    activities</u>, either sitting on the internet or <u>lying in bed having
    positive ideas about things</u>. He is also feeling more <u>worried about
    his sense of lack of social skills</u> and says that he will <u>say
    nothing most times in a group situation</u>, either at work or socially.
    He worries that he may be seen as <u>aloof or arrogant</u>.</li>
</ul>

<p>He is not particularly spontaneous and prefers to <u>plan and organise
things</u> in advance. Of note he said computers have been a
<u>special interest</u>, if not an obsession of his, since he was a young
child, and he would happily <u>spend all day playing or working on them if
not interrupted</u>.</p>

<p class="sidenote">(So this report got me a bit bummed out, because I read
into it like &quot;Oh, this ain't it, Chief&quot; and felt a bit silly for
barking up the Neurodivergent Tree. Psychologist had spoken and remarked that
actually I was Pretty Normal, and just... Anxious. I wonder if it would have
turned out differently had I had my school reports on hand then... Would they
have picked up on the ADHD characteristics? Would we both have still been
interpreting it through the lens of ASD? Would I have wound up with an Autism
diagnosis which didn't quite fit? What if it does fit a little, still...?)</p>

<p>Owain presented promptly with excellent self-care. He was clearly nervous
and there was some mildly decreased eye contact compared with normal but he
was readily engaged with fluent speech. I detected no idiosyncratic use of
language. He did not seem to struggle particularly with social cues. He said
his mood was a bit low and anxious but objectively I could not find any
evidence of pervasive mood symptoms. In his thoughts he has clear and high
functioning goals about his working life and he is clearly enthused by this.
His anxiety appears to be generalised and related to social confidence.
Cognition was intact, percept unremarkable and insight good.</p>

<p>I said to Owain that hw perhaps had very mild Asperger's symptoms, more
typical of traits than syndrome. We talked about medication for anxiety but
both agreed that actually it would be better to approach it using talking
therapy such as CBT.</p>

<h2 class="green">
    Industrial Year Placement Report (July 2013; me at 20 again)
</h2>

<p class="sidenote">(I include this because it adds to the picture - some of
the stuff I was told I needed to improve on as a kid was still there -
bad with mornings, sometimes rushing work, coming across badly or
misunderstandings, being shy and &quot;diffident&quot;. But conversely,
working really hard!! It goes to show though that there's things there that
I couldn't simply &quot;grow out of&quot; after childhood).</p>

<p>Some <u>absences that were unexplained until afterwards</u>,
<u>consistent late arrival at work</u> (though he did <u>as consistently
stay late</u>). Worked hard to meet deadlines for research starting dates.
Occasionally <u>needs to take a little more care with his work</u>, though
offsetting that we did have at least one very positive user comment about
Owain's work. A couple of occasions where work that was Owain's responsibility
<u>was not done</u>, though there is partial mitigation because he would argue
he didn't know he should have - we might suggest he should have, but it is
true he was <u>not told explicitly</u> - this may be more about initiative than
professionalism. Spoken to on several occasions for using Facebook on work time.
On the one hand his consistent lateness and other professionalism comments
would suggest a lack of commitment. On the other he has repeatedly worked late
and done more than might have been expected out of hours. On balance I think
the latter outweighs the former. Integrated well with other team members on
the same project, including working closely on research support. Has
communicated well with different customers via email. <u>Sometimes needs to
speak up a bit and try to be a bit less diffident</u>, but has no problem
getting his point across. Owain's technical abilities are strong and have
increased over the course of the year. Owain is an intelligent guy who is
capable of solving complex technical problems with limited supervision. This
will stand him in good stead eventually. It is unfair to give him a low grade
because his quality of work has been high. On standard of work I would grade
him &quot;Good&quot; on professionalism I would grade him &quot;Poor, but not
without merit&quot;.</p>

<h2 class="yellow">Psychiatrist's Assessment, February 2021</h2>

<p class="sidenote">(Including only the excerpt where the psychiatrist gave their opinion, as
everything else is background info. The &quot;relatively mild&quot; thing was
disheartening at the time, giving rise to impostor syndrome, but I should
think of it in terms of how well I've done, and remember how psychiatrists
look at things in terms of clinical risk.)</p>

<p>Owain has some evidence of inattentiveness and some symptoms of
hyperactivity including restlessness, difficulty falling asleep and engaging
in quiet leisure activities with others although however his symptoms are
<u>relatively mild</u>. [...] on balance we agreed probably that he is suffering
with some impairment and that a trial of stimulant medication would be
justified.</p>

<h2 class="orange">In conclusion</h2>

<p>Yeah, this might be a bit overshare-y or self-indulgent, broadcasting my
old school reports. But for me it's kinda cathartic. They will serve as a
reminder to my future self to think about what things kid me struggled with,
how I learnt to navigate around those struggles - and now I notice them more
clearly, perhaps there are <em>better</em> ways to deal. Although as my
adulty skull ossifies, I think I've

<p>Anyway - I've enjoyed writing these posts. I think I've got most of the
<em>me me me me</em> bits out of my system now. I'm still pretty fascinated
with figuring out how my brain ticks, neurodivergent thinking, excited by
the surrounding communities. I'll probably write more in future - but I'm
quite happy to have some Rest Days at last. And, next month, I might actually
<em>shut up about ADHD</em> for five minutes ðŸ˜…</p>
