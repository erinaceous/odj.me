Friday 22nd October, 2021</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2021-10-16-twelve-plus-one-days-of-adhd">October is ADHD
Awareness Month.</a> I've decided that I'm going to use that as a writing
prompt, and to set myself a challenge. For the next twelve days, I'm going
to <a href="/blog/2021-10-17-action-potential">write something</a>
<a href="/blog/2021-10-18-whoami">about my experiences</a>
<a href="/blog/2021-10-19-meds">learning about ADHD</a> as a

adult.</em></p>

<p><span class="magenta">After yesterday's mammoth post,</span>
I thought I'd do a brief one today about
how I've been thinking about the design of my blog and how it affects the
readability of long articles like that - and one experiment attempting to
improve on that.</p>

<!--/summary-->

<p><span class="violet">I have no idea</span>
if this is an ADHD Thing specifically or an Everyone Thing,
but I do find it difficult to read long passages of text with a high contrast,
sometimes. It seems to correlate with how tired, stressed or caffeinated I am.
But generally, black text on a bright white background, or bright white text
on a black background creates too much of an after-image for me, which makes
it quite difficult to scan lines of text.</p>

<p><span class="blue">On bad days</span>
I even get that effect with paperback books - although generally
books (and e-ink displays!) fare better than white A4 print-outs, as they tend
to be off-white. Doing literature reviews for my dissertations was pretty
painful, but at least academic literature tends to follow the convention of
having the text split across two columns going down the page. Nonetheless, I
had to arm myself with every colour of highlighter pen in order to actually
make it through a paper and take the information in without constantly losing
my place.</p>

<p><span class="cyan">It intrigues me</span>
that I have much less trouble reading syntax-highlighted
code - I'm staring at large chunks of text all the time in my job, but it never
strains my eyes or hurts my brain nearly as much as reading grayscale articles
designed for print. Syntax-highlighted code just feels a lot easier to read
for me.</p>

<p><span class="green">I think</span> there's a few things going on here:</p>

<ul class="long">
	<li>Syntax highlighting is <em class="yellow">colourful</em>;
	structure is demarcated
	using lots of <span class="orange">different</span>,
	<span class="red">highly-contrasting</span> colours.</li>
	<li><span class="magenta">(Unless you're a sociopath*)</span>
	convention is bright coloured text on
	dark backgrounds - the opposite of print media. Which makes sense when
	it's a backlit screen. Brightness causes glare and glow, so bright text
	benefits from looking "fatter", whereas black text gets washed out in
	the bright glow of its background.</li>
	<li><span class="violet">Code</span>
	generally has <em>lots of white-space</em>; different levels of
	indentation used a lot to show a heierarchy of ideas.</li>
	<li><span class="blue">Paradoxically,</span> although
	<a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/a/48777" target="_new">monospace fonts
	are supposed to be <em>worse</em> for readability</a>, a
	<a href="https://github.com/belluzj/fantasque-sans" target="_new">good monospace font</a>
	tries to remove any ambiguity between similar-looking letters:
	<strong>1, l, L, i, O, 0</strong>.</li>
	<li><span class="cyan">Line lengths:</span>
	I develop predominantly using Python, and I really like
	PEP-8's
	<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length" target="_new">maximum line length of 79 characters</a>
	rule. They suggest 72 characters for comment blocks - the parts of code
	that are intended to be the most human-readable. Minus the left-hand
	indentation, that's about the same as the rule of
	<a href="https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability" target="_new">50-60 characters per line</a>
	suggested by typographers.</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:75%"><span class="green">*I obviously have Strong Opinions</span>
about programming colour schemes here, but I'd be interested to hear if anyone
genuinely finds dark text on bright background more comfortable and preferable for
code stuff.</p>

<p><span class="yellow">I gave my homepage</span> that stylistic software-engineer
hacks-a-lot-in-the-terminal look as a signal to Other Nerds that This Nerd is
fairly good at Nerding. But inadvertently in the process, I feel like I've also
made it <strong>easier to read <em>for people like me</em></strong>.</p>

<p><span class="orange">The use of rotating colours</span>
for headers, unambiguous monospaced font,
off-white text on a black background, and maximum 60 character width pages
is a combination I find very easy to read, both on a big screen and on my phone.
The lines are also essentially doublespaced (line-height: 3ch;), which stops
characters with dangly bits from interfering with the letters below them
(I'm sure there's a typographical term for that).</p>

<p><span class="red">One additional</span>
readability trick I've added to the blog, as you will have
noticed, is a gradual change in the brightness of the text, going from mid-gray
to white. This is my attempt at copying
<a href="https://www.beelinereader.com/" target="_new">BeeLine Reader</a> (or
the free and open-source implementation
<a href="https://github.com/corollari/waspline-reader" target="_new">WaspLine Reader</a>),
which use a gradual change in colour or shade across paragraphs to make it easier
for you to scan over. The
<a href="#" onclick="document.getElementById('article').swap(); return false">toggle text gradient</a>
link in the header of this blog switches the effect on and off. You can
<a href="https://github.com/erinaceous/odj.me/blob/master/static/bumbleline.js" target="_new">steal my implementation</a>
of it if you'd like.</p>

<p><span class="magenta">My homepage</span>
was never intended to be place in which I'd write long form text
for a general audience; it's just my digital business card / contact details / CV,
after all. But now I have a few people reading these posts as I share them - so
I'd be interested to hear whether I've made it a comfortable reading experience for
everyone else - or not! Especially the gradually changing text colour. Like, I'd
like to know whether I'm helping or hindering anyone who'd dyslexic, or has other
visual processing foibles like the ones I've described for myself. Also, whether
the font makes things better or worse.</p>
