<p align="right"><strong class="red">12 Days of ADHD 7: Senses
</strong><br />
Saturday 23rd October, 2021</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2021-10-16-twelve-plus-one-days-of-adhd">October is ADHD
Awareness Month.</a> I've decided that I'm going to use that as a writing
prompt, and to set myself a challenge. For the next twelve days, I'm going
to <a href="/blog/2021-10-17-action-potential">write something</a>
<a href="/blog/2021-10-18-whoami">about my experiences</a>
<a href="/blog/2021-10-19-meds">learning about ADHD</a> as a
<a href="/blog/2021-10-20-haiku">very</a>
<a href="/blog/2021-10-21-how-did-i-get-here">recently diagnosed</a>
<a href="/blog/2021-10-22-a11y">adult.</a></em></p>

<p>It's nice that people have encouraged me to keep on writing, and a few have
said that it's been genuinely insightful reading about how my mind ticks.
Today, I thought I'd have a crack at describing, literally, <em>how I perceive
the world.</em></p>

<h2 class="magenta">The sensory side of being neurodivergent</h2>

<p><em>Sensory overload</em> is something that's widely known about; we know
how loudness, crowded places, strong smells, uncomfortable sensations and
motion sickness can all lead to over-stimulation and cause people a lot of
grief for people across a myriad of diagnoses, from Autism, ADHD, PTSD,
Generalised Anxiety, Scizophrenia, Chronic Fatigue, and a whole host of other
neurological conditions - as well as sap the general population of their
energy, too.</p>

	<img src="https://i.redd.it/oje8252v2pn71.png" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>However, I feel like it's not something that gets highlighted much when
it comes to ADHD. Sure, we <em>talk</em> about getting overwhelmed, but
nowhere in
<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/diagnosis.html" target="_blank">diagnostic</a>
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519712/table/ch3.t3/" target="_blank">criteria</a>
is there any mention of it. ADHD diagnoses are all to do with <em>how you
present to other people</em>, with no mention of, say, sensory overload.</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/me0mr4/but_youve_done_so_well_in_life_how_can_you_have/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
	<img src="https://i.redd.it/zerqehalcgp61.png" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>Due to that, and due to the fact that your own senses are internal to you
and very individual, I feel like the sensory side often gets under-explained
and overlooked. There are things that I've noticed about myself, which may
be things which everyone experiences, may be characteristics of ADHD, or
may be just me specifically, and that ambiguity makes it tricky to know whether
these things are <em>treatable</em> or simply <em>part of the human
condition</em>. The ones I'll mention though, I've asked various people about
in the past - friends and family - and they've sounded perplexed, so maybe
these are down to having a neurodivergent brain!</p>

<h2 class="violet">Visual Snow</h2>

<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Example-of-visual-snow-Patients-with-visual-snow-observe-tiny-dots-in-the-entire-visual_fig3_334772397" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">

</a>

<p>This is something I've always taken for granted - when I was younger I
thought everyone experienced this. You might think I'm talking about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floater" target="_blank">floaters</a>,
the squiggly things you see when you look at a blue sky, but no. I'm talking
about having a persistent level of "TV static" or "film grain" that's always
there, regardless of how much light is getting to your eyes. I believe that
we all get it to some degree - when it's very dark, or even pitch black,
your rods and cones aren't impervious to noise, so we all get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigengrau" target="_blank">Eigengrau</a>.
</p>

<p>What's different for me, is that <em>I can be looking at bright white
surfaces</em> and <em>still</em> be looking at it through a strong field of
colourful static, which flickers and strobes subtly. I also get auras around
areas of high contrast, such as strong edges, and strong edges also create
after-images as I look around - which can be quite annoying when reading
black-on-white text, as I alluded to
<a href="/blog/2021-10-22-a11y" target="_blank">last post</a>. If you close
your eyes whilst in a well-lit room, look at something with strong edges and
you might get what I mean - the after-image will persist for a few seconds
and slowly fade (I assume). However, do you get the same effect <em>if you
keep your eyes open?</em> I do - and I'm not sure if that's common. It's
something that seems to get worse when I haven't slept well, my blood sugar's
low, or I'm frazzled, stressed, anxious or overwhelmed. I think what I'm
describing here is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palinopsia" target="_blank">Palinopsia</a>.
</p>

<p>I also tend to get glare from all light sources. Everyone gets glare, but
this might be strange - if you've ever looked at a UV light, you might get
this - I can look at the light and focus on it directly, so it has
a strong clear edge and the bright object is perfectly in focus, but at the
same time the light from it is blurry and it <em>feels</em> like I need to
focus on it more. It's not due to one eye being slightly out of focus with
the other, because it persists <em>even with only one eye open</em>. It's like
I have to shift my <em>attention</em> between the glare and the light-emitting
object, rather than physically adjusting my focus.</p>

<p>Lastly - I tend to actively notice floaters <em>all the time</em>, not just
when occasionally looking at a blue sky or a uniformly bright surface. Maybe
that one's down to me being hyper-attentive to visual stuff.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
	function flipSnow() {
		var img = document.getElementById('snow');
		if(img.classList.contains('snow')) {
			img.classList.remove('snow');
			img.src = 'https://i.imgur.com/s1RuEEz.jpg';
		} else {
			img.classList.add('snow');
			//img.src = 'https://i.imgur.com/C3rqGIb.gif';
            img.src = 'https://i.imgur.com/rMW9dnY.gif';
		}
	}
</script>

<p>Here's an example of the things I've described.<br />

<p>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rMW9dnY.gif" class="snow" id="snow" style="max-width:100%" />
</p>

<p>There is also a good simulation of visual snow
<a href="https://visionsimulations.com/visual-snow.htm" target="_blank">on this website</a>,
as well as simulations of the other things I've described (so aside from
the snow, maybe the rest are Regular People Things?).</p>

<p>These are things which I've always experienced, and for the most part they
don't bother me; they're more of a curiosity than anything. Though sometimes
they can be quite distracting - imagine going into a quiet study room in a
university library. Zero distractions. No noise. Well lit. Just you and a
paper you need to read. Literally all you have to do is sit there and read
through this paper - <em>already</em> willing your mind to stay on task - and
then you have to compete with <em>this bullshit</em> for your attention too!
</p>

</a>

<p>What I've been describing has come under the umbrella of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow" target="_blank">"Visual Snow"</a>
which is something that is undergoing <em>some</em> research, but doesn't
appear to be understood much yet. Potentially there are
<a href="https://eyewiki.aao.org/Visual_Snow" target="_blank">some links</a>
between ADHD/Dyslexia and visual snow, although very few studies appear to
have been done on this. It also appears to be connected to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder" target="_blank">Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD)</a>,
though I can't remember
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/l2gcrm/andrew_from_all_gas_no_brakes_talks_about/" target="_blank">taking heroic doses of shrooms</a>
when I was a baby, so I think it's safe to say there's correlation not
causation there. Still,
someone has provided an example of HPPD vision which feels similar to how
I see things...</p>

</a>

<p>I think a major problem with this stuff is that <em>it isn't necessarily
a direct visual impairment</em>. It doesn't stop me from reading. I take
regular eye-tests for my job (it's Very Important to know you're still fit
for Mariner Duties, for your desk-job as a software engineer), and I've never
had any physical problems with my vision - never needed glasses. It's not
something that's <em>easy to objectively test</em>. All we can really do
is <em>describe it</em>, so it's at the mercy of our abilities to do that.</p>

<h2 class="blue">Auditory Processing</h2>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/ps51gg/what_was_that_jennhasadhd/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/rzc3joqweqo71.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=f834b342097573f5bc1be582ad249e6ec5a66889" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>Today I learned that
<a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/auditory-processing-disorder/" target="_blank">Auditory Processing Disorder</a>
is an entirely separate thing from ADHD! Which in retrospect makes sense -
there's
<a href="https://www.understood.org/articles/en/the-difference-between-auditory-processing-disorder-and-adhd" target="_blank">plenty of overlap</a>
between ADHD and APD, and
<a href="https://www.autism.org/auditory-processing-asd/" target="_blank">it fits under the Autism umbrella</a>
too. Up to an
<a href="https://www.auditorycenter.com/what-is-auditory-processing-disorder/prevalence-of-apd/" target="_blank">estimated half</a>
of people with ADHD may have Auditory Processing Disorder, and potentially up
to 70% of people with dyslexia.</p>

<h3 class="cyan">When we can't hear enough</h3>

<p><strong>&quot;You need your ears tested, boy!&quot;</strong> was a common
remark throughout my childhood. At the time, it was really difficult to
explain to people that the reason I couldn't hear them was because of a faint
noise <em>in another room</em> - &quot;Sorry, could you repeat yourself for
the fourth time because the cat is playing with a plastic bag on the other
side of the house&quot; sounds like an <em>excuse</em>, like you're
deliberately being <em>difficult</em>.</p>

<p>A friend of mine describes it eloquently as <em>&quot;Everything is the
same volume and the subtitles are delayed.&quot;</em> That is definitely my
experience too. The reason why I always switch subtitles on for videos, much
to the annoyance of people who get bothered by the text. If I don't, any
background sounds (like, people talking, or just general domestic ambiance)
is going to completely drown out the dialogue. <em>And,</em> it takes me a
little while to <em>process what's being said</em>.</p>

<p>It's not that I'm hard of hearing <em>at all</em>. The same medical where
I get my 20/20 vision tested, I get my hearing tested, and it's perfectly
acute, even as I'm getting older and have subjected it to a lot of loud
environments. It's the <em>content</em> of the sounds that I have difficulties
with.</p>

<p>It doesn't come across great when you have to ask people to repeat
themselves more than thrice, so there's a tendency to try and muddle by and
infer the missing information from what I've already heard. Which leads to
people thinking <em>I'm not listening</em>.</p>

<p>The sometimes-delay in parsing the spoken word also causes difficulties. I'm
not very good at signalling that I'm thinking about whatever's been said -
you know when people use filler sounds
<em>&quot;uhhhhh, um, hmmmmm&quot;</em>... Sometimes doing that requires
<em>conscious effort</em> on my behalf, so it's like... I can either think
about what you just asked me, or I can make noise. So sometimes come across
as a bit blank-faced and silent for longer than is expected, which can
frustrate people as they think I'm just ignoring them. There's like, a certain
time window in which it feels socially acceptable to respond to something
somebody's said, which oftentimes I feel like I miss, and either of our
attention has moved onto something else.</p>

</ul>

<p>I've had friends tell me that I'm at my best in one-to-one situations;
those are when I open up the most. The more people you add to a group
conversation, the quieter I can become. There's just a lot going on - a
lot of conversations to keep track of, and I can't necessarily choose which
ones I pay attention to. Similarly, if the environment is too "busy" or
there's a lot of multi-tasking happening, I have trouble.</p>

</a>

<p>I'm better when I'm <em>prepared</em> for a conversation to happen - like,
I'm expecting it to. I'm also better when I have a <em>script</em>, or I have
an idea of how it's going to go. I struggle the most with completely ad-hoc
interactions out of the blue. That's when I go <em>&quot;huh?&quot;</em> or
<em>[garbled noises]</em> or go mute, or don't really know what's going on.
Sometimes, you're like an action figure toy that has a set number of
catchphrases. The Quintessentially British thing to do is just to lightly
chuckle at whatever was said and hope that they made a joke, or that you're
agreeing with them somehow. <em>&quot;Hahaha, fair. Cool.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 class="green">When we can hear too much</h3>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/qbcj24/team/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
    <img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/o74RtGcXvr2usoxe5E380Ql19d5mfabOpjm-6U8hvPE.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=845f9a5e90ba23d47df0f095d8f2942a9c8de57e" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>It always baffled me as a kid how people weren't <em>paying attention</em>
to the same sounds I was. <em>Was it not bothering them?</em> Like, why was
I the only one to hear the cathode-ray-tube-transformer whine of the TV,
which was still switched on but left on a black screen? Why was nobody else
bothered by the ultrasonic buzz of fluorescent lights? How were they able to
sleep when <em>clocks were ticking</em> downstairs? Or when
<em>standby LEDs were squealing</em> on electronics?</p>

<p>This still bothers me today, but I have found that I've got more used to
it. Once you find the source of the sound, or it's part of an environment
<em>that you control</em>, it doesn't seem so bad. I have smart lights in
every room in my flat. I can hear the imperceptible squeal they make
communicating over wifi - it's a constant background sound. I can tell when
they're sending bursts of data. I can hear the transformer whine from my
computer's power supply. In my car, I can hear the faint little <em>thunk</em>
noise my speakers make when the brake lights come on. I pay <em>far too much
attention</em> to the refrigerant gurgle of kitchen fridges - although that's
something me and a few of my friends share. When we shared a house in
university, we had a fridge that sounded <strong>so goddamn satisfied with
itself</strong>, with its faint little <em>hmmmmm,</em> and cow mooing noises.
Smug bastard fridge.</p>

<p>I'd say that a lot of my <em>distraction sounds</em> are the almost
imperceptible ones which other people appear to filter out because they're
so quiet and just part of the environment (unless they have a tendency to be
hyper-vigilant, in which case they'll pick up on them too, with varying levels
of being able to ignore them after first hearing them). It's like, they're
<em>so quiet</em> that my brain <em>wants</em> to direct its attention to
<em>listening really carefully</em> to them.</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/lod240/too_many_sounds/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
  <img src="https://preview.redd.it/mdei361fcoi61.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=19701713bcb4f9bf550b486ac2d2453cf9521fe2" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>I live next to a train line. You know what doesn't ever ever distract me?
Multiple carriage diesel passenger trains going past my window once an hour
throughout the day at 40 miles per hour. The brief, loud rumbling noise does
not faze me in the slightest. But you know what <em>will</em> distract me?
The sound of robin hopping onto a branch in the hedge that separates my
garden from the railway line.</p>

<p>It's that kind of tiny sound that used to really bug me, which I think
could make me quite snappy. Sensory overload doesn't necessarily mean
<em>loud and bright</em> - it can mean <em>too many subtle things</em>. And
being overwhelmed doesn't necessarily mean you scrunch your eyes shut and
clap your hands over your ears or curl into a ball or nope out of that place.
Sometimes it can make you irritable, prickly, or a simmering, boiling vat
of unbridled rage, about to snap at whomever is unfortunate enough to cause
the next diversion of attention.</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/ndfbi2/if_i_had_to_pick_the_worst_thing_about_adhd_it/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
    <img src="https://i.redd.it/hw7rakethez61.jpg" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>As I've gotten older, I've at least learnt when I'm beginning to feel
overwhelmed, and I'm able to react more reasonably, although it can still
feel unreasonable when I have to explain to people - &quot;Sorry, I have to
get out of here and have a break a second. This is too much.&quot; (Must just
be an excuse for me to duck out of whatever social obligation, right? It
<em>sounds</em> like a <em>made up thing</em>...). But, I'm grateful for the
people who <em>do</em> understand, or make the effort to understand.</p>

<h2 class="yellow">When the Sensory Overload's Just Right 👌</h2>

<p>It might sound a bit contradictory, but <em>I fucking love loud noise</em>.
Blasting music in headphones? Great. Festivals, gigs, raves, standing next
to the speaker stacks, sounds so loud your eyeballs vibrate - those things
<strong>give me energy</strong>. Coupled with dark, crowded environments
full of bright, flashing and strobing lights and lots of movement. You'd think
that would be a <em>nightmare</em> for sensory overload - but it's like the
complete opposite. It's like the music and the lights are so overpowering to
the senses that any <em>distractions</em> from them are completely overpowered,
leaving oneself free to completely get lost in the experience. I can totally
go into a state of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">flow</a>
in those environments. It's like a warm bath or a comforting hug for the
senses.</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/my9xee/_/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/xguisbgu2cv61.jpg?width=960&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=89e5335f2a7ecddbb8bfad4798e34b029e262b42" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>Loud music in headphones, I think a lot of people can appreciate is a
great concentration aid - so I'm definitely not saying that <em>this</em>
is a strictly neurodivergent thing; I just wanted to point out yet another
curious paradox of the brain here.</p>

<h3 class="green">Not-Tinnitus</h3>

<p>I've also always been aware of a very faint high pitched ringing that feels
internal. It's like... the subtle hiss of air, or the sound of my brain
working. Maybe it's the sound of blood pumping close to my ears. It certainly
hasn't come from hearing damage. It may well be the
<a href="https://journals.lww.com/thehearingjournal/Fulltext/2017/05000/What_Visual_Snow_May_Tell_Us_About_Tinnitus.9.aspx" target="_blank">auditory counterpart</a>
to the visual snow.</p>

<h3 class="yellow">The other senses</h3>

<p>For me, vision and hearing are the senses that I predominantly notice the
most issues with, namely because they're what get used the most. That's not
to say that this is an exhaustive list. The other senses can be just as
distracting - <em>oh god I can feel my cuticles again. I am <strong>too aware
of having skin right now. <u>My pulse is keeping me awake.</u></strong></em>
(With the latter - BP and HR unremarkable. Literally can be at 60bpm resting
heart rate and 120/70 blood pressure, still gonna notice my heartbeat. Does
anyone else get this when trying to fall asleep?). Then there's stuff like
clothes tags, faint scents, the things my internal organs are busy doing.
&quot;I need to get comfy in order to read&quot; translates to
<em>&quot;Can't read this book while my intestines are busy.&quot;</em></p>

<h3 class="orange">Spinning Plates</h3>

<p>Imagine you've just started learning to drive - the way you handle the car
requires a lot of conscious thought, perhaps it feels quite overwhelming and
you feel pretty mentally tired by the end of your lesson. You make a lot of
mistakes, the car judders and movements are clumsy. There's just so much to
keep track of, which experienced drivers are able to do subconsciously; their
brains now treating the car as an extension of their bodies.</p>

<p>That's kinda how I feel with social situations, sometimes. With the
cacophony of sensory things going on, on top of parallel streams of inner
thoughts - it's no wonder I feel myself coming across as quite clumsy and
awkward. There's so much to keep track of sometimes. It's like I have to do
a lot more things consciously that other people can do automatically, all
the while having to make the conscious decision to ignore sensory stimuli that
normally people just filter out when higher priority things are happening.
There's barely enough mental bandwidth left over to keep track of
conversations, let alone take an active part in them!</p>

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme/comments/pp6byc/keep_trying_to_master_this/" target="_blank" class="no-decoration">
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/1xg4yaeklsn71.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=7ef8894bb402d99a2491e19d437d932300ff8ab2" style="max-width:100%" />
</a>

<p>Sometimes, it feels like trying to keep a whole bunch of spinning plates
up in the fair. If I divert my attention to replying to something someone's
said, I may very well lose track of what my hands are doing and fling red
wine over their wall, or lose my balance and smother their sofa in chocolate
cake, or for some reason now <em>my thumbs are bleeding??????</em></p>

<p>It's annoying, and it's knackering, but c'est la vie. I'm starting to learn
how to make things easier for myself, and it gets easier as I get older.
Part of that process is just explaining all of this to other people, and
<em>learning that it's okay to ask for accommodations</em>.</p>
