<p><em><a href="/blog/2021-10-16-twelve-plus-one-days-of-adhd">October is ADHD
Awareness Month.</a> I've decided that I'm going to use that as a writing
prompt, and to set myself a challenge. For the next twelve days, I'm going
to <a href="/blog/2021-10-17-action-potential">write something</a>
<a href="/blog/2021-10-18-whoami">about my experiences</a> learning about ADHD
as a very recently diagnosed adult.</em></p>

<p>Today, I returned from my medication hiatus. My day has been one of
productive, ordered calm, so it's probably a good time to write about
medication for the benefit of my future self.</p>

<!--/summary-->

<p>Since my diagnosis in mid February, I've been taking a low
dose of stimulant medication. Other than good sleep, good exercise and good
food, stimulant meds are the first line of treatment for ADHD. You probably
know about some of them - Adderall (amphetamine/dextroamphetamine). That's
the one that's known for its abuse potential. Although, on a tangent - those
who "abuse" it are usually American college students or young professionals
who take it because they believe they <em>need</em> to have an edge on their
<em>competition</em>, pressured to be at top performance by a society that
values capital over human welfare. <em>Grumble grumble.</em> I assume that here
in the UK we have the same issues, but certainly when I was in uni nobody was
really talking about adderall, especially not to deal with deadlines or
exam revision. <em>(We just got drunk instead.)</em></p>

<p>The stereotype of the super-powered person rushing around on adderall being
super productive is a curious one to me, as is the fact that stimulant meds
are supposedly highly addictive substances. For one thing -
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3489818/" target="_new">they may not actually have much of an effect on neurotypical individuals</a>.
Secondly, I've been on this dangerous, highly controlled, addictive substance
for about 9 months and I routinely <em>take days off</em> despite it being
a medication designed to be taken every day, and I am still on
<em>the lowest therapeutic dose available</em>. I don't crave it on the days
that I don't take it.</p>

<p>Perplexing stigmas aside - it really does make a difference. I'm currently
alternating between Concerta XR (an extended-release brand of methylphenidate)
and Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine). Both take about 30 minutes to kick in, and last
for around 12-13 hours, so taken once a day before I've even woken up properly.
I'll probably settle on Elvanse, having had the chance to test both - but what
dosage and what drug and what release profile suits someone is highly
individual. Turns out I'm quite sensitive to stimulants, so I'm quite happy
staying on the lowest dose (18mg-20mg of both) - even though the therapeutic
dosages go all the way up to ~70mg/day. I set an alarm, 30 minutes before my
"real" alarm goes off, take my meds, and by the time the "real" alarm hits, it's
starting to kick in.</p>

<p>It feels like a more laid back version of coffee - barely raises heart rate,
but gives me a motivated feeling. I notice that I am more likely to do things
when I think of them, rather than "I'll do that later". I find it easier to do
a bunch of things in parallel. Subjectively, I feel like I simultaneously slow
down but also speed up - I do things more efficiently. I feel like it becomes
easier to talk and have ad-lib conversations and express myself on the fly. On
my medicated days, I can become a lot more organised, able to keep myself on
task, calm and collected in my thoughts, able to keep more things in working
memory, able to put things in order better. I feel more "rewarded" for doing
all the Bullshit But Invariably Self-Care Chores. One time, I was actively
enjoying <em>ironing</em>.</p>

<p>Plenty of people describe their first time trying medication as their
"Ah-ha!" moment - <em>"is this what it's like to be functioning normally!?"</em>
But for me, it was more like a series of subtle <em>"huh,"</em> moments, where
I noticed some small way in which I was doing better. My favourite moments
were when I was running or going on walks, and noticing that, for brief moments,
<em>my brain was quiet</em>. Being able to actually just <em>be in the present
moment</em> felt really new to me, and it's really nice when it happens.

</p>

<p>When I first started taking them, I designed myself a chart to track what
effect the meds were having on my symptoms. It's really subjective and only
makes sense to me - but my hope was that if I plotted my scores I'd be able
to correlate an upwards tick in good things and a downwards tick in bad
things on medication days. I never got around to properly plotting the data,
but there was <em>some trend</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/XR7p9Q9.png" style="width:100%" /></p>

<p>After the first month or so I stopped tracking it on the chart as I was
confident that subjectively the meds were having a positive effect on my
focus and motivation. What I really wish I had though, was a proper
objective test I could do every day - like a few brain training games on a
phone app, that would give me an objective score about, say, how good my
working memory was that day.</p>

<p>After the first couple of months, the meds started to blend into the
background and I developed a bit of a tolerance. The initial side effects
(dry mouth was a big one for me, though that was it really) had dwindled
away, but it felt like it was having less of an effect. So I upped my
dose a few times and tried taking it every day. <em>Then I learned how much
is "too much" for me.</em> The dark side of stimulant meds is: getting
stuck <em>doing</em> tasks, as opposed to <em>not doing</em> them. Like,
hyper-focusing on work, to the detriment of my free time. I also
found that I felt a bit "zombie-like" some days - just kinda... Numb.
When it wore off, I felt more impulsive. It felt like I'd been using up
extra dopamine reserves and I was a bit fried.</p>

<p>Took a step back, went back on to the lowest dose, took rest days
again, and crucially, <em>got better sleep.</em> Turns out that I am very
sensitive to sleep too, and the meds don't do much if I'm not well-rested.
Unfortunately, <em>stimulant meds can also make it harder to fall
asleep</em> - especially the extended-release ones I'm taking. I'd not
really appreciated that at the time. It's not something I've solved; but
I'm annoyingly naturally insomniac anyway and the meds don't increase that
much. My current solution is over-the-counter Promethazine, an
antihistamine which can be used to induce drowsiness when taken near
bedtime. It's not a long-term solution, and it's something you can build
up a tolerance too also, so taking some every other day, so I have a
reasonable amount of days in the week where I sleep like a normal person.</p>

<p>(As an aside, I tried altering my circadian rhythm with melatonin
supplements for a while, but they just made me wake up earlier - didn't
help me feel sleepier earlier in the night. Cool room, darkness, no blue
lights at night, meditation, chamomile tea, exercise in the day, no caffeine,
weighted blankets -- tried all that, but Asshole Brain still wants to stay
awake until 4am feeling bored without chemical intervention)</p>

<p>So, after 9 months, what do I think of the meds? They are <em>great</em>
- in moderation. They really do help, but I need to appreciate that of
utmost importance is <em>sleep</em>. I'll continue taking meds; it becomes
quite obvious on the second or third day off them when I'm back to my
baseline self, how they <em>had</em> been helping.</p>

<p>I'd be interested to try the other non-stimulant medications around,
like Strattera (atomoxetine), but for now I think I'll stick with Elvanse
for a while - maybe like a year.</p>
