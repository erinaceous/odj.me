Potential</strong><br />
Sunday 17th October, 2021</p>

<p><em><a href="/blog/2021-10-16-twelve-plus-one-days-of-adhd">October is ADHD
Awareness Month.</a> I've decided that I'm going to use that as a writing
prompt, and to set myself a challenge. For the next twelve days, I'm going
to write something about my experiences learning about ADHD as a very
recently diagnosed adult.</em></p>

<p>I've been off my stimulant medication for three days, something which
I will occasionally do to give myself a break, try and not build up a
tolerance, and save a bit of money. Day three has been particularly
trying, when it comes to checking things I wanted to do off of my to-do
list. Rather than getting any of it done, I spent the day in a frustrated
fog. It however did at least give me my first thing to write about - having
spent most of the day glancing wistfully at my running shoes and thinking
<em>"If only I had the Action Potential for this shit."</em></p>

<p><strong>Action Potential</strong> is the change in electric potential
between two sides of a cell. It's something that plays a central role in
neuron-to-neuron communication in your brain. Dopamine happens to be one
of the neurotransmitters which is usually shunted around your brain via
exocytosis, the cause of which is... action potentials! Dopamine has a
myriad of uses in the brain, and it's a deficit of dopamine which is
associated with ADHD.</p>

<p><strong>Spoon Theory</strong> is a metaphor oft used to describe the
varying energy reserves an individual person may have on a day-to-day
basis - anyone can start off their day with finite energy to do particular
mental or physical tasks.</p>

<p>I totally get the idea of spoon theory, but I'd not ever use it when
referring to myself. Never, "I don't have spoons for this". As it was a
term coined by a chronic illness sufferer - for people who are having to
manage their pain all day long - it feels a little appropriative for me to
use... Err... Spoonerisms... when I can't figure out why it's so difficult
to do laundry.</p>

<p>But <em>damn</em>, some days I do <em>not</em> have the dopamine to be doing
things.</p>

<p>There's a paradox with ADHD - I'm sure we've all had times when we've been
glued to the sofa, finding it difficult to go start something which we actually
want to do. What happens to some of us, though - is that the threshold for
action is a lot greater. We can literally be lying there looking very docile on
the surface whilst [screaming internally] at ourselves to go do the Thing. And
of course, the natural solution is to <em>just go and do it!</em> You'll Feel
Better If You Just Try&trade;! But despite the conscious desire and the external
pressure, the Thing remains undone.</p>

<p>People with Parkinson's also have reduced levels of dopamine. This can create
a marked difficulty with performing actions which involve the brain shunting
about a lot of dopamine - repetitive movements, tasks with complex orders of
actions, walking through doors (giving rise to the "Doorway Effect"). There are
some very clear signs that there's not enough dopamine to go around - people
report themselves literally feeling frozen mid-action in what feel to be very
specific situations.</p>

<p>It strikes me that <strong>Action Potential</strong> is a pretty good double
entendre to describe the dopaminergic mental reserves we have at any given
moment. Having a tough day? Paradoxically tired but restless? Can't concentrate?
Can't remember things? Can't put things in order? Finding it difficult to keep
track of time? Sleep cycle out of whack with daylight? Sensitive to lights and
sounds? Getting your words jumbled as they come out of your mouth? Clumsy?
Finding it difficult to read because every strong edge you look at leaves an
after-image? Visual snow? Several lines of the Malcolm In The Middle theme tune
been on loop in your head since you woke up? Would be able to out-sprint an apex
predator should the need arise, but in between taking the laundry out of the
machine and hanging it out, you need a good several hour sit down? Is staring at
walls becoming a fascinating hobby? Does it feel like your brain has had a
chemical bath and been rinsed of The Good Stuff and you need to go back to bed and
restart everything tomorrow? Having trouble finishing lists of</p>

<p>Maybe you're lacking <strong>Action Potential</strong> today! As in, you lack
the Potential for Action - because you don't have enough of <em>the main
neurotransmitter responsible for signalling throughout large parts of the brain
and nervous system</em>. And therefore, you should be kinder to yourself. You
don't have enough spoonfuls of action. Maybe you had a particularly busy and
productive day yesterday, or a stressful exam, or you drove for a couple of hours,
or you had to interact with large crowds of people for the day, or a bad night's
sleep, or all of those things, or none of those things - maybe everything was going
swell and your brain just decided to screw with you today.</p>

<p>That won't stop you from chastising yourself for being a Lazy Garbage Fire,
but at least you'll have compassion for others, and you'll have a short and snappy
new term to use with your friends when you find yourself Unable.</p>

<p>It's not <em>tiredness</em> - although a lack of sleep does have a big effect on
how we function. But you can be perfectly well rested and still have the same
difficulties. Which is what makes it so tricky to explain to people sometimes -
it's not "lacking discipline" or "needing motivation". It's something more
fundamental, more physical, more chemical than that. It's <strong>difficulties
regulating executive function and working memory</strong>, and treating it the
same you would any physical ailment.</p>
