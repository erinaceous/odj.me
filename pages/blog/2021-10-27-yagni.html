<p>Today is a shorter one, because I have had / am still having an incredibly
busy day. Today was one of those days where, looking back at it, I was
<em>incredibly</em> productive - I'll probably be in recovery-mode by the
weekend. Like my dad says, &quot;burning the candle at both ends!&quot;</p>

<p>Today's post is about YAGNI.</p>

<p>Earlier, I came back from a first aid unit meeting with some more <em>stuff</em>.
We've been clearing out the storage cupboards this evening, and with Halloween
drawing near, I <em>gleefully</em> snapped up the old boxes of Casualty
Make-up. <strong>Fake blood and bruise wheels galore!</strong></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/wVtZCc6.jpeg" style="max-width:100%" />
</p>

<p>But, I mean... I'm <em>fully</em> aware I'll use this stuff once this
weekend. Then it will all be stacked in the corner of my flat with all the
other Stuff which I accrue over time, revisited only when I am moving out.
Without intervention, I will probably end up taking it with me then too.</p>

</p>

<p>I'm trying to reduce the amount of clutter in my life, though - I have
a tendency to keep stuff, not hoarding for sentimental reasons - but out of
sheer inability to comprehend <em>how</em> or <em>when</em> to get rid of it.
I know full well where, and when is easily now, but always feels like
<a href="/blog/2021-10-26-time">infinity future</a>.</p>

<ul class="long">
    <li>Me: &quot;But how do I get rid of old batteries tho&quot;</li>
    <li>Rational me: &quot;You take them to that fancy bin in the big Tesco.
        You've seen it. Just put it on a to do list for next time you go
        there.&quot;</li>
    <li>Me: &quot;OR, hear me out, I put them in an old HUMMUS POT along with
        burnt out light-bulbs and dried up printer cartridges, and then I
        LEAVE THEM NEXT TO THE KETTLE for HALF A YEAR!&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/mUErfRJ.jpeg" style="max-width:100%" />
</p>

<p>In work, in a team of software developers, we do try to stick to the
principle of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">You aren't gonna need it</a>
as much as we can - <em>What's the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) we can get
done in 2 weeks?</em></p>

<p>It's probably a pretty good thing to apply to my own life too -
<em>Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just
foresee that you need them.</em></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ogRiG1U.jpeg" style="max-width:100%" />
    <em>This was an ill-purchased mini tabletop dishwasher that only washes
    one meals' worth of stuff at a time. It's quicker and more efficient to
    just wash stuff by hand, it takes more cognitive effort trying to tetris
    things into this.</em>
</p>

<p>I don't think I have the right lifestyle right now to be storing loads of
stuff for Future Me. I'm still quite restless, and want to up sticks and
move, go travel for a bit. One day, I'll want to be a homeowner, and maybe
then I'll feel justified about keeping the remnants of abandoned hobbies. But,
for now...</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/evFTBAF.jpeg" style="max-width:100%" />
    <em>Behold, Shame Corner! Where electronic musical instruments, exercise
    equipment, deteriorating camping gear, outdated computer equipment
    and abandoned crafts projects come to die. (And my Masters' Thesis in the
    top right, having seen better days in the sky...)</em>
</p>

<p>I think there's something about
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/minimalism/comments/92l0xa/how_minimalism_has_helped_my_adhd/" target="_blank">being more minimalist</a>
that soothes an ADHD mind. I have a tendency to clutter, stuff gets stuffed
into corners haphazardly rather than neatly arranged. Anything out of sight,
is out of mind. </p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/K9HM0ko.jpeg" style="max-width:100%" />
    <em>Each of these is almost-but-not-quite empty, and I keep forgetting
    to use the last of each before buying more, and thus the mountain of
    year-old grooming products grows exponentially.</em>
</p>

<p>Part of the reason why I keep everything is a low-level guilt at the
idea of <em>just</em> chucking it; everything has a use. I'd rather see it
used, repurposed or recycled, retaining some of its inherent value, rather
than go to landfill. <em>And maybe one day I'll have a use for that circuit
board from a broken remote controlled car!</em></p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RFaTkyh.jpeg" style="max-width:100%" />
    <em>Because OF COURSE a bubble wand, a toy bow and arrow, and a 🤦 tinder
    sun-visor 🤦 need to remain precariously balanced on top of my bookshelf
    for eternity. Net Worth: Probably $$ Millions $$, I'll bet.</em>
</p>

<p>But again, <em>there are places I can take this stuff</em> for
<em>somebody else</em> to make use of <em>now</em>, and I <em>know this</em>.
But on all the free weekends I have, my Goblin Brain does <em>not</em> want
to sort through all my stuff in a sensible fashion, determining what is junk,
what can be sold, what can be recycled, what can be donated, what can be
handed down... It's <em>immediately</em> overwhelming and so I just decide
I'm going to deal with it later. The ADHD brain has an annoying habit of
thinking about <em>too many things in parallel</em> and we get stuck in
<a href="https://marlacummins.com/where-to-start-adhd-clutter-overwhelm/" target="_blank">choice paralysis</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/xxIOor8.jpeg" style="max-width:100%" />
    <em>WHYYYY am I stockpiling empty bottles of interesting liqueurs and
        WINE CORKS!?</em>
</p>

<p>I actually did start to sort through my stuff last year, during the
lockdowns. Not gonna lie, each time was mentally exhausting. But it was
at least rewarding afterwards. I donated a whole bunch of old but still
perfectly functional electronics to
<a href="https://jamies.org.uk/?v=79cba1185463">Jamie's Computers</a> in
Southampton. I took weird bits of scrap metal to the recycling centre.
Upgraded my PC, but gave the old one to my dad. Donated like three big sacks
of wearable but old and outgrown clothes.</p>

    </a>
</p>

<p>And in the midst of that, I think I slowed down on acquiring <em>new</em>
Stuff, as
<span class="orange">Y</span><span class="red">A</span><span class="magenta">G</span><span class="violet">N</span><span class="blue">I</span>
started ringing in my ears. Now when I see Cool Junk I could Totally Use For
A Hobby Project, I think... <em>&quot;will I be using this in a year?&quot;</em>
and the answer is emphatically <em>NO</em>.</p>

<p>Here's the kind of places I picture myself in the Abstract Future:</p>

<p>All of this scenery... Requires <em>minimal possessions</em>. All the
clutter I have accrued in my life-time, adds to my own
&quot;mental clutter&quot;. I often have the desire to just... Reboot
everything. Dispose of most of my worldly, material goods, and just start
from scratch.</p>

<p>But reality is that you <em>have</em> to keep ahold of some stuff, and
you <em>will</em> keep hold of other things, because
<a href="https://digcoaching.com/why-decluttering-systems-dont-always-work/" target="_blank">sentimentality <em>is</em> important</a>.
What I want to get better at is <em>thinking more carefully</em>
before obtaining new Stuff, and making more concrete decisions as to when
I should get rid of things.</p>

<p>With all the crap I've acquired, it's a little embarrassing to admit,
but in order to bootstrap de-cluttering to the point I want to be de-cluttered,
<em>I think I need external help</em>. One of those occasions where I feel like
I'm really sucking at being An Adult. More brains for sorting through it all,
because by myself it is just way too much to fit in my brain. I'm lucky to
have a couple of mates who are willing to give me a hand with it ❤️ I just
need to get around asking for their help - another thing that is
Infinity Future in my mind.</p>

<p>I've started to catch myself now<span class="cyan">*</span> when I feel
impulse-purchases, or I'm eyeing up freecycle things, and I'm starting to
ask:</p>

<ul class="long">
    <li>Will this be immediately useful to me?</li>
    <li>Is this of high quality?</li>
    <li>Will this last?</li>
    <li>How easy will this be to get rid of after?</li>
    <li>Is this for a hobby I'll lose interest in, in a months time?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I want to start
<a href="https://adhdboss.com/minimalism-adhd/" target="_blank">working out what my essential items are</a>,
and
<a href="https://untappedbrilliance.com/how-to-eliminate-clutter-when-you-have-adhd/" target="_blank">finding new ways</a>
to break The Great De-Clutter into more digestible chunks.</p>

<p>And the grand question I'm beginning to ask as I get a bit older, is -
<em>Am I Going To Need It? What is the Minimum Viable Product of my life in
order to sustain happiness?</em></p>

<p><em><span class="cyan">*</span>(well, not <em>now</em> now, having brought
two toolboxes full of fake blood home with me)</em></p>
